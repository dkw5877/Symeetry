Symeetry Project

Interested in meeting people around you that have similar interests? 
Symmetry pairs iBeacon technology with your iPhone so that you can meet new people in real time,
get to know each other and synergize on projects, endeavors, and other interests into the future.


Symeetry was the final project at the Mobile Makers Academy which is an immersive iOS Bootcamp teaching Tools,
